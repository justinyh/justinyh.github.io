                    <p>I was born & raised in a small suburb of Des Moines, Iowa. My parents immigrated to the United States in search of opportunity for their kids. As I grew up, they always taught me the value of dedication and dreaming big.</p>
                    <p>These days, I often think about how they left their families and lives behind and came across the Pacific Ocean with nothing but a few hundred dollars to their name. I asked them if they were scared to make such a crazy journey, they replied, "No honestly, we were excited!" And I think that sums up their attitude towards life.</p>
                    <p>Their story inspires me every day to pursue new experiences, even if theyâ€™re a bit scary. From them, I get my adventurous spirit and ambitious drive.</p>
